Learning to collaborate with github

Here is the link to our [website](https://eleanorecc.github.io/collab-website/)!

This website consists of a single page. Here we outline our ideas for a final collaborative website. Our final website will have pages on Rmarkdown, Github, and OHI theory where we will summarize key concepts and organize troubleshooting tips. The final website will include a blog as well, which we will use to document our process of learning about the OHI global index and how it is calculated.
