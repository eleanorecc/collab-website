## Outline for Final Collab Website


### Tabs/Subsections:

### Home
The home page of our website we envision as being a timeline with our progress on the OHI adventure. The timeline will be drawn vertically, the top being time 0 (January 2018, when we started learning the necesary tools), and the bottom being x (September, when we finally have OHI scores!). Along the timeline we think on having different points showing our achievement, issues, problems, comments throughout the process. This notes are going to be devided in the following section (each one representig a tab of the website): Blog, R &Rmarkdown, Github and OHI Theory. What each tab will contain is described bellow.
