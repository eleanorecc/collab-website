## Outline for Final Collab Website


### Tabs/Subsections:

### Home

The timeline will be drawn vertically, the top being time 0 (January 2018, when we started learning the necesary tools), and the bottom being x (September, when we finally have OHI scores!). Along the timeline we think on having different points showing our achievement, issues, problems, comments throughout the process.
